                    <h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
                    <p>This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this
                    Terms of Service as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all
                    disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you
                    and YellowGirlfriend, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service
                    (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any
                    aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall
                    be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a
                    court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that
                    you may assert individual claims in small claims court,
                    if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude
                    you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies,
                    and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief
                    against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of
                    Service, you and YellowGirlfriend are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or
                    to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined
                    by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act
                                        governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

                    <h3>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
                                    </h3>
                    <p><strong>YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
                    ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
                    PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND
                    COMPANY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE
                    THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY
                    FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE
                    ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY
                    RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE
                    EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL
                                            CLAIM(S).</strong></p>

                    <h3>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</h3>
                    <p>YellowGirlfriend is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and
                    efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the
                    customer’s satisfaction by emailing customer support at yellowgirlfriend@gmail.com.
                    If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must
                    first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute
                    (“Notice”). The Notice to YellowGirlfriend should be sent to
                                        <a href="mailto:yellowgirlfriend@gmail.com">yellowgirlfriend@gmail.com</a> (“Notice
                                        Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
                                        dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Eunit
                                        Designs and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after
                                        the Notice is received, you or YellowGirlfriend may commence an arbitration
                                        proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement
                                        offer made by YellowGirlfriend or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator
                                        until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Eunit
                                        Designs is entitled.</p>

                    <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
                    <p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by
                    the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

                    <h3>Severability</h3>
                    <p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
                    Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled “Prohibition of
                    Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above)
                    is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision
                    with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
                    expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
                    term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so
                    modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of
                    subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative
                    Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the
                    entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of
                                        the Terms of Service will continue to apply.</p>

                    <h3>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</h3>
                    <p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, Eunit
                    Designs agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement
                    (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are
                    a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending YellowGirlfriend
                    written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice
                    Address provided above. By rejecting any future change,
                    you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance
                    with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first
                    accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent
                                        changes to these Terms of Service).</p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Termination</h2>
                <p>You agree that YellowGirlfriend, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your
                account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content
                within the Service, for any reason, including, without
                limitation, for lack of use or if YellowGirlfriend believes that you have violated or acted
                inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected
                fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may
                be grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law
                enforcement authorities. YellowGirlfriend may also in its sole discretion and at any time
                discontinue providing the Service, or any part
                thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the
                Service under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior
                notice, and acknowledge and agree that YellowGirlfriend
                may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files
                in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you
                agree that YellowGirlfriend will not be liable
                                to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>
                <h2>User Disputes</h2>
                <p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in
                connection with the Service and YellowGirlfriend will have no liability or responsibility
                with respect thereto. YellowGirlfriend reserves the
                right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you
                                and any other user of the Service.</p>
                <h2>General</h2>
                <p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and YellowGirlfriend and
                govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Eunit
                Designs with respect to the Service. You also may
                be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or
                third party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms of
                Service will be governed by the laws of the State
                of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any
                disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and YellowGirlfriend
                agree to submit to the personal and exclusive
                jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County,
                California. The failure of YellowGirlfriend to exercise or enforce any right or provision
                of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver
                of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a
                court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the
                court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’
                intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of
                Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law
                to the contrary, any claim or cause of action
                arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed
                within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A
                printed version of this agreement and of any
                notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative
                proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to
                the same conditions as other business documents and
                records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this
                Terms of Service without the prior written consent of YellowGirlfriend, but YellowGirlfriend
                may assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in
                whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are
                for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made
                via either email or regular mail. The Service
                may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by
                                displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.</p>
